Q2: Arithmetic Operations
# Problem:
# Take two numbers as input from the user and print their:
# sum, difference, product, and quotient.
# ---------------------------------------------

num1=int(input("enter first number"))
num2=int(input("enter second number"))
sum=num1+num2
difference=num1-num2
product=num1*num2
quotient=num1/num2
#print(f"sum of {num1} and {num2} is {sum}")
#print(f"difference of {num1} and {num2} is {difference}")
#print(f"product of {num1} and {num2} is {product}")
#print(f"quotient of {num1} and {num2} is {quotient}")

print("sum is:",sum)
print("difference is:",difference)
print("product is:",product)
print("quotient is:",quotient)
